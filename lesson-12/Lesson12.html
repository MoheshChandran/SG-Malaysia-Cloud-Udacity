	<h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
		<p>
		Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the internet.<br>
			The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the internet that allows you to manage:
		<ul>
			<li>Storage services like databases</li>
			<li>Servers, compute power, networking</li>
			<li>Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality</li>
			<li>Security services for data and applications</li>

		</ul>
		And has the following characteristics.
		<ul>
			<li>Pay as you go</li>
			<li>Autoscaling: the number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.</li>
			<li>Serverless: allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
		
	<h3>Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS): The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers. </li> 
			<li>Platform-as-a-Service(PaaS): A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure.</li>
			<li>Software-as-a-Service(SaaS): A software application that runs over the internet and is managed by the service provider.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
	
	<h3>Cloud Deployment Model</h3>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Public Cloud: A public ccloud makes resources available over the internet to the general public. </li>
			<li>Private Cloud: A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.</li>
			<li>Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud. <br>
				This ia a graowing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry.</li>
			
		</ul>
		</p>
	<h3>Common Benefits</h3>
		<p>
			Several benefits to the cloud.
		<ul>
			<li>Stop guessing about capacity.</li>
			<li>Avoid huge capital investment up front.</li>
			<li>Pay for only what you use.</li>
			<li>Scale globally in minutes.</li>
			<li>Deliver faster.</li>
		</ul>

		</p>
	<h3>Options</h3>
		<p>
		Popular Cloud service providers
		<ul>
			<li> Amazon Web Services (AWS) </li>
			<li> Google Cloud Platform (GCP) </li>
			<li> Microsoft Azure <li>
		</ul>
		</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>
AWS offers a diverse set of cloud-based products. 
<ul>
	<li>Analytics</li>
	<li>Application integration</li>
	<li>Cost managment</li>
	<li>Compute services</li>
	<li>Database maangement services</li>
	<li>Developer tools</li>
	<li>Security services</li>
	<li>Additional Services such as Blockchain, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, IoT, and AR/VR/</li>
</ul>
