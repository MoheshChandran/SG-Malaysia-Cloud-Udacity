			<h3>Creat a Pull Request</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A <em>pull request</em> is a request to the original or source repository's maintainer to include changes in their project that you made in your fork or their project.
        <li>Prior to the send pull request to the group or open-source projects, make sure you check the below<li>
          <ol>
            <li>reviewing the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file
            <li>checking out the project's existing issues
            <li>talking with the project maintainer 
          </ol>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Stay in sync with source project</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Star: to keep track of repositories (the button is located in the right-up side of the github repository webpage.)
        <li> Watch: also useful to keep track of the repositories. Unlike adding 'star' this is not really related to the populatity of the project.
        <li> "git remote add upstream <URL of a repository>" - <strong>upstream</strong> as the shortname to reference the source repository. 
        <li> "git fetch upstream master" - to retrieve upstream changes. 
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Manage an active PR</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Make use of "Conversation" tab in GitHub to communicate back and forth with the project's maintainer to clarify exactly what they want! 
        <li>Also, as most developers participating in open source projects are doing it unpaid, therefore, remeber to: 
          <ul>
            <li> be kind 
            <li> be patient - project maintainer will repond as soon as they are able to! 
          </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Squash Commits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"git rebase" command, to squash commits altogether! 
        <li>"git rebase" command will move commits to have a <em>new base</em>. 
        <li>"git rebase -i HEAD~3" : This command line is telling Git to use "HEAD~3" as the base where all of the other commits will connect to.
        <li>Also, "-i" here mans "interactive", to use rebase command in 'interactive mode'. 
      </ul>
