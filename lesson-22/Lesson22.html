			<h3>Security Group</h3> 
			<p>Security Groups are associated with EC2 instances and provide security at the protocol and port access level. 
				Each security group, working much the same way as a firewall
				-contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance
			</p>
			<p>Security groups are specific to individual resources (EC2 servers, databases) and not to subnets</p>
			<p>	Ingress rules: 
			<ul> 
				  <li>Ingress rules are for inbound traffic</li> 
				  <li>Ingress rules restrict or allow traffic trying to reach our resources on specific ports</li> 
				  <li>For ingress rules, we want to limit inbound traffic, for security, to a single port or just a handful of ports required by the application we are running</li>
			</ul>  
			<p>	Egress rules: 
			<ul> 
				<li>Egress rules are for outbound traffic</li> 
				<li>Egress rules restrict or allow traffic originating from our server</li>
				<li>For egress rules, we want to give the resource full access to the internet, so we give egress access to all ports, from 0 all the way to 65535</li> 
			</ul>  
			</p>
			<p>Traffic is blocked by default</p>

			<h3> Auto Scaling Concepts</h3>
  			<p>	Monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Scaling Policy
					<p>A Scaling Policy is the criteria used to decide when to Add or Remove Servers from your Auto Scaling Group</p>
				</li> 
				<li>Launch Configuration
					<p>A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances</p>
				</li>
				<li>Load Balancer
					<p>A load balancer allows you to reduce your Auto Scaling down and Scale up easily, and user will not feel any different</p>
				</li> 
			</ul>   
			</p>

			<h3>Adding Target Groups and Listeners</h3> 
			<p>A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances, fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others<p>
			<p>A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. 
				The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to the targets in one or more target group</p>
			<p>Health Checks are the requests your Application Load Balancer periodically sends to its registered targets</p>
