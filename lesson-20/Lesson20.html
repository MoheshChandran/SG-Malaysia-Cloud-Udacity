			<h3>Draw the Architecture with Lucid Chart</h3>
				<p> The arcchitecture as being thought in the course is as below.</p>
				<img src="lucid-chart.PNG" alt="The architecture">
				<p> <strong>Lucid chart</strong> is used to create cloud diagrams. But we can use Visio or Cloudcraft.<br/>
				Navigate to <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com">Lucid Chart</a> to create the diagram. <br/>
				Then, click <strong> Blank Diagram </strong> to select a blank template.<br/>
				Select both <strong>AWS Architecture 2017</strong> and <strong> AWS Architecture 2019</strong> to get all the necessary figures.</p>
				
			<h3>Availability Zones</h3>
				<p> Availability Zones (AZ) is a set of one or more data centers (physical buildings). <br/>
				<ol>
					<li>Choose to have more than one availability zone to avoid a single point of failure.</li>
					<li>Include more than one availability zone to design for high availability.</li>
					<li>You may choose to reduce to one AZ, possibly for prototyping and design for low cost. But it is not recommended for production environments.</li>
				</ol></p>
			<h3>Virtual Private Cloud </h3>
				<p>A virtual private cloud is a pool of networked cloud resources. It can span more than one availability zone.<br/>
				The equivalent of this would be a data center. However, thanks to availability zones, VPCs can span more than one physical building. <br/>
				This is an amazing feature that protects against real world disasters like electrical failures, fires and similar events.

				<strong>Subnets</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>Create separation between resources</li>
					<li>Block or allow to/from groups of resources</li>
					<li>Provide services to a specific to a specific set of resources</li>
				</ol>
				<strong>Keypoints to remember!</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>VPCs provide you with private IP addresses for your networking resources.</li>
					<li>Subnets are smaller subsets of your available IP address space</li>
					<li>The /00 at the end is the number of bits, from left to right that are fixed.</li>
					<li>Subnets help with routing and services to specific groups of resources</li>
					<li>Create subnets and VPCs with future expansion in mind!</li>
				</ol>
